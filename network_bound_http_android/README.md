# Network Bound HTTP Android

This package implements the Android-specific functionality for the
`network_bound_http` federated plugin.

It handles HTTP requests using a specific network interface (Wi-Fi, cellular, or default)
and provides direct download to file with progress tracking.

⚠️ Android only.
