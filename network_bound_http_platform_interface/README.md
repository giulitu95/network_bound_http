# Network Bound HTTP Platform Interface

This package defines the platform interface for the `network_bound_http` federated plugin.

It declares the methods and types that each platform implementation (Android, iOS, etc.)
must implement, allowing `network_bound_http` to be extended to other platforms in the future.
